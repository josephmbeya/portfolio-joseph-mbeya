        <p>
          Hi, I'm Joseph Mbeya, a passionate full-stack developer with a love for creating 
          innovative web applications and solving complex problems through code.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          My journey in software development began with curiosity about how websites work, 
          which quickly evolved into a deep passion for building digital experiences. 
          I enjoy the entire development process, from conceptualizing ideas to deploying 
          production-ready applications.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
        <p>I work with a variety of technologies including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS</li>
          <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express, API development</li>
          <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis</li>
          <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Git, Docker, Vercel, AWS</li>
          <li><strong>Languages:</strong> JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and staying up-to-date with 
          the latest technologies and best practices. I'm particularly interested in 
          modern web development patterns, performance optimization, and user experience.
        </p>
        
        <h2>When I'm Not Coding</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of development, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to 
          open-source projects, and sharing knowledge through writing and mentoring. 
          I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with fellow developers.
